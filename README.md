# Cybersecurity Case Files
Welcome to my **SOC Analyst Lab Portfolio** - My collection of hands-on cases (P1-P6), mini Python tools I built and also the job simulations offered by some companies on **Forage** website while training for CompTIA CySA+ and SOC workflows.

## Python Projects
Practical **mini Python tools** created to support SOC workflows - parsing logs, enriching IOCs, generating SIEM summaries, and automating triage tasks.  
Each script has its own doc (Objective -> Usage -> Output -> Notes) with sample runs and screenshots.

## Forage Projects
These are structured virtual experience projects from **Forage**, simulating real-world SOC and cybersecurity analyst tasks:

- [Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity](./Forage-Projects/commonwealth-bank.md)
- [AIG Shileds Up: Cybersecurity](./Forage-Projects/AIG-shields-up.md)
- [Telstra Cybersecurity](./Forage-Projects/Telstra.md)
